Product Launch Update: SmartWidget Pro

Important Notice

We regret to inform our customers that the SmartWidget Pro launch has been delayed due to technical issues discovered during final testing. The product will not be available for pre-order on January 15, 2025, as previously announced.

Technical Issues

During final testing, we discovered several technical issues that need to be resolved:
- Battery life is only 24 hours instead of the promised 48 hours
- Waterproof rating is IP65 instead of IP68
- Performance is only 25% faster than competitors, not 50%

Market Impact

Due to these delays and technical issues, we have revised our sales projections:
- Expected sales: 50,000 units in the first quarter (down from 100,000)
- Expected revenue: $20 million (down from $30 million)
